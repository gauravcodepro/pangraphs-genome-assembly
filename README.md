# pangraphs-genome-assembly
- This code is constantly updated and also a docker withe several integrations is in preparation which will allow you to run the dockerized analysis. 
- a complete workflow that can be dockerized for the long read assembly, it allows for the genome assembly update as well as it allows for the assembly from the start. if you have the illumina reads it allows for the genome mapping also. 
- 2023-10-20, finished code first release: next update will be with the genome visualization tracts. 
- 2023-10-21, Finished update: major changes to the code, added associative arrays and added the support for the multiple genome polishing such as pilon and jasper and also the coverage analysis
